# calmcode
a collection of Jupyter Notebooks for [calmcode.io](https://calmcode.io/) lessons (or hugging face chapter quiz results).  

###### NOTE: Some of these notebooks utilize raw cells to represent command line prompts. These won't render in the GitHub preview but show up fine in Jupyter Notebook or nbviewer (e.g. [ngrok in nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/ericphann/calmcode/blob/main/ngrok.ipynb)). Just FYI in case some notebooks feel like they're missing code. For future notebooks I'll refrain from using raw cells and probably use backticks in Markdown instead.
